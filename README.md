# Periodic Elemental 2048

Periodic Elemental 2048 is a periodic table of elements inspired game based on the famous 2048 game.

Instead of numbers, we have elements of the periodic table represented by their symbols. When combined, they form higher periodic table elements.

My main objective was to make learning fun instead of boring. The aim here is to learn chemical reactions via playing 2048.

## To Do:

- [ ] Introduce level concepts (Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3)
- [ ] Level 1 Smaller elements combine to form higher elements
- [ ] Level 2 Introduction of radicals and combination of elements and radicals to form compounds e.g (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)
- [ ] Level 3 Chemical reactions between compounds e.g (HCl + NaOH -> Nacl + H<sub>2</sub>0)
- [X] Elements up to Potassium have been introduced
- [X] Randomize Tile addition to make the Gameplay Interesting
- [ ] Elements after Potassium to be introduced
- [ ] Concepts of Inert Gases can be introduced and they will not do anything when combined with other elements showing their inertness to reactions
- [ ] Further suggestions for improvement
