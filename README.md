# Periodic Elemental 2048

Periodic Elemental 2048 is a periodic table of elements inspired game based on the famous 2048 game.

Instead of numbers, we have elements of the periodic table represented by their symbols. When combined, they form higher periodic table elements. 

For example, He(2) and He(2) are combined to Be(4).
